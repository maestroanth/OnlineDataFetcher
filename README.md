# OnlineDataFetcher

About: Originally Created and Compiled and Ran in Eclipse IDE as a school project.  Really small main() in NetGetter.java file class which should be in a file of it's own.

Purpose: Uses regular expressions to go through websites automatically and collect data based on cropping the HTML file.  For anyone who wishes to work on this, it doesn't do much with that data except outputs it in a java GUI which displays to the user every few seconds.  

Other Purpose?: The code should provide an adequate template for any type of website data fetching need.  A good marketing route idea I had would be to rewrite it as an automated online dating data fetcher for lazy guys (or girls) who don't want to waste time sending messages. (The program would surf profiles, grab certain data, and input that data into some message template so it appears customized just for the person they are sending the message to. From here you can either code an additional similar program that sends it, or just simply store the profile data and templates in a file that the user can tweak and then send themselves).  I figure one could sell such an app pretty successfully for those lazy daters who want to easily play the odds!

Feel free to message me if you want to branch off on this!
